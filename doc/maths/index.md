# Notation and conventions

These pages give the mathematics behind every number this application can ask
for. They are written to be read beside the interface: each one says which
control feeds which symbol, and where the formula lives in QuantLib's own
source, so a claim here can be checked against the code that produced the
price.

Citations of the form `ql/pricingengines/...` are paths inside the QuantLib
checkout vendored in the backend repository at `third_party/QuantLib`, pinned
at **v1.43**.

## Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $S$ | Spot price of the underlying | a quote in the market pane |
| $K$ | Strike | the payoff |
| $T$ | Time to expiry, in years by the volatility's day count | the exercise date against the evaluation date |
| $r$ | Continuously compounded risk-free rate | the risk-free curve |
| $q$ | Continuous dividend yield | the dividend curve; **absent means zero** |
| $\sigma$ | Black volatility | the volatility object |
| $b = r - q$ | Cost of carry | implied by the process |
| $D_r = P(0,T)$ | Risk-free discount factor | read off the curve, not $e^{-rT}$ |
| $D_q$ | Dividend discount factor | read off the dividend curve |
| $F = S\,D_q/D_r$ | Forward price to $T$ | computed by the engine |
| $H$ | Barrier level | the style block |
| $\rho$ | Correlation | a quote, for quanto |
| $N(\cdot),\ \varphi(\cdot)$ | Standard normal distribution and density | |

Two conventions are worth stating explicitly because they are where hand
calculations usually diverge from the service's answer:

**Discount factors come from curves, not from a rate.** QuantLib's engines ask
the term structure for $P(0,T)$ and for the forward, so a non-flat curve is
handled exactly rather than by an effective flat rate. Where these pages write
$e^{-rT}$ they mean $D_r$; the two coincide only for a flat continuously
compounded curve.

**Time is a day count, not a subtraction.** $T$ is the year fraction the
relevant term structure's day counter produces between the evaluation date and
the expiry. Change the day counter and $T$ changes, which changes the price.

## The pages

The root table of contents carries them; in the order they build on each other:

- {doc}`black-scholes` — the model everything here prices in, and the payoffs
- {doc}`greeks` — the nineteen result kinds, and why an engine withholds one
- {doc}`american` — early exercise, the three approximations, the seven trees
- {doc}`exotics` — barrier, double barrier, Asian, lookback, forward start
- {doc}`quanto` — the drift adjustment, and reading its sign
- {doc}`rates` — discounting, bootstrapping, and what a swap is worth
- {doc}`numerics` — what each method's error looks like, and what it costs
